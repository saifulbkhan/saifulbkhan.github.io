This sucks. I got nothing going on.

.

.

.

What will I even be doing after 5 years? Slave to a company and my job at this rate.

.

.

.

Gotta make something of my own.

.

.

.

Ya this idea is really cool. I don't think anybody is doing it. I mean not exactly like how I am doing it.

.

.

.

I got a lot of validation from my 3 hour online research on the use-case. Totally on the right path.

.

.

.

So many cool libraries I could use to make this thing in my head a reality.

.

.

.

_Too_ many cool libraries and frameworks. Better invest 4 weeks learning these new technologies, lest I choose the "wrong" one.

.

.

.

Yeah, I am gonna become so smart in the process.

.

.

.

Probably end up with a few million dollars after this is successful. Might never have to listen to managers and seniors tell me what to do ever again.

.

.

.

Wonder what I will do with that kind of money...

.

.

.

Yeah I am pumped!

.

.

.

Now that I have it all planned out, I could use some entertainment. Gonna waste some time on YouTube, or maybe scroll Twitter.
