        <p>I'm not really much of a traveler or outgoing in any way. So when I was invited to <a href="http://2016.guadec.org">GUADEC</a>, I wasn't very sure about it. It took some encouragement from my mentor and a fellow GSoC mate to convince me. And... I'm glad I went!</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>It was one of those things that I could not have experienced from my comfy chair to which I reserve myself for the greater part of my day. In fact this trip makes me feel I might be wrong about social interactions not being time well spent for me (but then again I don't exactly buckle down into ambitious projects, so you're free to call me ignorant).</p>
<p>This wasn't a conference of geeky people talking geeky stuff (was it?) but a reflection of the GNOME community as a whole. Discussions involved both experienced as well as young members or interns like myself; and the place was full of developers, designers, translators and not to mention the organizers/volunteers who made sure throughout the conference that we didn't have to worry about logistics and stuff. Oh and big thanks to you guys for the food and the vouchers. I made sure they were put to use. :D</p>
<p>So in short this is how I'd summarize my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to new places and meeting people was fun.</li>
<li>Some of the conference talks were really got me thinking.</li>
<li>Open source is more than just making your code being open for others to see.</li>
<li>Productivity and interest in a BoF session is directly proportional to your contribution and how much you learn.</li>
<li>Travelling together or sharing a dinner table can spark interesting conversations.</li>
<li>I had a peek into the vision that the members have for GNOME.</li>
<li>I had some great time with my mentor.</li>
<li>I don't actually suck on the stage (I gave a lightning talk!).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry if using a list is a crappy way of documenting one's travels. But overall I'd say this visit has given me a different outlook and confidence towards being a contributor to GNOME and the open source community in general. Thank you GNOME for sponsoring me.</p>

<p>And another big thanks to the organizers for arranging the picnic and other lovely excursions! I'll make sure to provide a helping hand next time.</p>
<p>By the way... I used to think the 'G' was silent. :P</p>
